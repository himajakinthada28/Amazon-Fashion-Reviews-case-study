# Amazon-Fashion-Reviews-case-study

Overview:
The model developed in this project is based on 'Item-Item' similarity. Here, the products are recommended based on the item that the user is currently seeing and doesn't take into account what his/her previous shopping habits have been. 
I have made 2 models for Recommendations which consider :
1. Title similarity and cosine distance.
2. Unsupervised learning algorithm (Nearest Neighbours).
